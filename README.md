# CS305 Artemis Financial – Portfolio Reflection

## Client Summary
The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a financial services organization responsible for storing and protecting sensitive customer information. The company requested guidance on improving secure software practices, specifically around encrypting long-term archived data to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and regulatory compliance.

## Strengths and Importance of Secure Coding
I performed well in evaluating secure encryption options and recommending AES-256-GCM as an appropriate solution for protecting archived data. Secure coding is essential because it helps prevent data breaches, protects customer trust, and reduces long-term financial and legal risk for organizations handling sensitive information.

## Challenging and Helpful Aspects
The most challenging aspect of this project was recognizing that strong security depends not only on the encryption algorithm, but also on proper key management and correct implementation. This was also the most helpful part, as it reinforced how real-world security issues often stem from configuration and process weaknesses rather than broken algorithms.

## Security Improvements and Future Assessment Methods
Security was strengthened by recommending strong encryption, secure key management practices, and integrity validation. In future projects, I would continue using vulnerability assessments, secure coding standards, and OWASP guidance to identify risks and determine appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Ensuring Security and Functionality
To ensure the solution remained both functional and secure, I reviewed the proposed implementation to confirm that encryption did not interfere with system usability. I also considered potential risks such as key exposure and improper initialization vector usage to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Practices Used
This project relied on industry standards and best practices, including NIST recommendations and secure software design principles. These resources will be valuable in future coursework and professional environments where security-focused development is required.

## Portfolio Artifact
This repository contains the Artemis Financial Secure Software Practices report, which demonstrates my ability to apply secure software concepts, evaluate encryption strategies, and document security decisions in a professional manner.
